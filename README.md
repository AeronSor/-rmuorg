Super simple script for organizing your replay folder for GGXXAC+R with ease

# Instructions

## Linux
If you're on linux just git clone the repo, install the dependencies from the .txt and run the script as is

## Windows
You can also just run the script with python but I have also provided a binary for it

1. Place the release folder or script anywhere you want
2. Run the binary orscript and type the path where your replays are saved( usually at "Documents/ARC SYSTEM WORKS/GGXXAC/Replays")
3. Insert your user name on GGXXAC+R do not misstype this >:( (it might break)
4. Click submit
5. Done

Now the replay section of your game should be configured with the Matchup folders.
Whenever you stack more replays do the same
